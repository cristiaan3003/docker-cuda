docker-cuda
===========

Minimal container with CUDA drivers as a base for GPU computing.

Installs only the driver without the enourmous toolkit. I use this as a base for Folding and BOINC images, but it could certainly be used elsewhere.

### Next:

- Surely there's direct link to driver only download somewhere on the developer site. The package I'm using is 900MB.
